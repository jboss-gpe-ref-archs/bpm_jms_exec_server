== BPM Suite 6 Execution Server:  JMS API
This reference architecture provides a detailed example of how to configure and use the JMS API of the BPM Suite 6 Execution Server.
Also included is a demo project with step-by-step instructions on how to deploy and execute it.

This reference architecture deep-dives into two major use cases related to JMS and BPM Suite 6:

. `JMS Execution Server API` 
+
Starting a BPM Suite 6 process via the JMS API of the BPM Suite 6 Execution Server.  

. `JMSProducerTask` 
+
Sends a JMS message during execution of a BPM Suite 6 process to a remote JMS queue.

:numbered:

== Overview
=== Asynchroneous Messaging via JMS
Asynchroneous messaging is often used in a Service Oriented Architected solution for the following reasons:

. *Decoupling* - 
Any time two independent systems are required to communicate, there is the high potential that they will differ in processing speed and availability.
This leads to the need for asynchronous communication to decouple the sender from the receiver.
The two systems can be extended and modified independently as long as they adhere to the same interface requirements.
The JMS API provides a well-known interface allowing for significant flexibility for how the two connected systems may be managed.
. *Redundancy* - The message may be held safely in the queue until the receiver is able to process the message without errors.  The queue safely holds onto
the request in the message until the the process explicitly indicates that the message has been received and processed.
. *Scalability* - Scaling with JMS is straight-forward.  If messages are being processed too slowly, simply add more processes to receive and process the messages.
. *Resiliency* - If the message receiving process fails, crashes, or is just down for maintenance, the decoupling provided by the JMS interface allows the message
producer to continue, unharmed by the the issues on consumer.
. *Delivery Guarantees* - The redundancy provided by JMS means that message delivery is guaranteed.
In many cases, queues are configured to be durable; their state is even guaranteed to survive a server crash on the JMS broker, because messages are saved to a storage device.
. *Ordering Guarantees* - 
Various options are available for controlling the ordering of messages received from a queue, however the most common configuration is to provide
the messages in FIFO order (First In, First Out).
. *Buffering* - BPM is particularly well-suited for handling long-running business processes.  While a message producer may produce many messages in a day, a long-running business
process may have numerous wait-states and thus could take days to process.  It is critical that messages from producer systems are queued for processing when
consumer processing resources become available.

=== JMS  and BPM Suite 6
In regards to BPM Suite 6, JMS is often used in the following manner:

. A JMS message may be sent to the BPM Suite 6 server to start or signal a process.
. A BPMN2 process may need to send a JMS message to a topic or queue.

In this reference architecture, a JMS client starts a BPMN2 process instance by invoking the JMS API of a remote BPM Suite 6 server (hosted in OpenShift Enterprise).
Inclued in the payload of the JMS request is an application specific domain model object.
In this reference architecture, the `JMS client application` refers to a JVM running outside the BPM Suite 6 Execution Server.  
See the following diagram for an illustration of this use case.

.JMS Transport Architecture Diagram
image::images/jms_transport_arch_diagram.png[width="60%"]

==== Client JVM
The client JVM typically runs on separate hardware from the server JVM.

==== JMS Client
The JMS client has access to the application domain classes as dependencies. 
System properties for the client are read from the the pom.xml file associated with the client's project.
In addition, the client has dependencies on the HornetQ client libraries for making connections with the HornetQ broker.

==== pom.xml
The pom.xml file contains a plugin for JMeter allowing the JMeter tests to be run by issuing a Maven build command of `mvn clean verify`.
The pom.xml file also contains the values for numerous properties used by the client.

==== Application Domain
The application domain is a library of POJO objects that define the business objects used by the use case.  
For the purposes of this reference architecture, the domain classes are `Driver` and `Policy`.
The domain library must be made available to the client, as a standard Maven dependency.
It is also made available to the server as a static module.

==== HornetQ
HornetQ is the default JMS broker available on JBoss EAP.
For this reference architecture, four queues are defined in HornetQ.  
These will be view-able via the JBoss EAP console as described below.

==== Maven Repository
Apache Maven is a distributed build automation tool used in Java application development to create, manage, and build software projects. 
Maven uses standard configuration files called Project Object Model, or POM, files to define projects and manage the build process.
POMs describe the module and component dependencies, build order, and targets for the resulting project packaging and output using an XML file.
This ensures that the project is built in a correct and uniform manner.
For more information on Maven see {maven}.

==== Execution Server
The Execution Server exposes BPM Suite 6 functionality as a service.
Clients can interact with the BPM Suite 6 execution server via either REST or JMS.
For this reference architecture the Execution Server is the component that enables access to the process engine via JMS. 

==== BPM Suite 6 Process Engine
The BPM Suite 6 Process Engine is responsible for managing the state of BPMN2 process instances.
This reference architecture includes a very simple BPMN2 process definition:

image::images/bpmn.png[width="40%"]

Instances of this BPMN2 process definition will be instantiated and their lifecycle managed by the BPM Suite 6 Process Engine.

===  JMS Service Task
The purpose of the JMS Service Task is to send messages to a JMS Queue or Topic from a business process.

The following architecture diagram illustrates the components required for the JMS Service Task.

.JMS Service Task Architecture Diagram
image::images/JMS_WIH_arch_diagram.png[width="60%"]

Many of the components here have already been discussed in the previous section.
The additional components required by the JMS service task are discussed below.

==== JMS Service WIH
This reference architecture includes the following custom workItemHandler implementation:

-----
com.redhat.gpe.refarch.bpm_jms_exec_server.processTier.JMSWorkItemHandler
-----

This custom workItemHandler is mapped to a `ServiceTask` whose name is:  `JMSProducerTask`.

When a process instance is created that contains a `JMSProducerTask` Service Task, the process engine will create an instance of `com.redhat.gpe.refarch.bpm_jms_exec_server.processTier.JMSWorkItemHandler` .

== Pre-Requisites
The remainder of this documentation provides instructions for installation, configuration and execution of this reference architecture in Red Hat's Partner Demo System.  
The following is a list of pre-requisites:

. OPENTLC-SSO credentials
+
`OPENTLC-SSO` user credentials are used to log into the Red Hat Partner Demo System (PDS).
If you do not currently have an `OPENTLC-SSO` userId, please email: `OPEN-program@redhat.com`.

. Familiarity with Partner Demo System
+
If you are not already familiar with Red Hat's `Partner Demo System`, please execute what is detailed in the {mwlaboverviewsetup} guide.
Doing so will ensure that you are proficient with the tooling and workflow needed to complete this reference architecture in an OpenShift Platform as a Service environment.

. Familiarity with {bpmproduct}

== Provision OpenShift Applications
Partner Demo System allows for the creation and hosting of JBoss BPM Suite 6 runtimes in a cloud environment.

This cloud environment is powered by Red Hat's OpenShift Enterprise Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) environment.
You can access this online lab environment 24/7.
Using this lab environment enables you to focus on developing services and business logic using JBoss middleware instead of installation and configuration details.

=== Provision BPM Suite 6 application

. Open the `Openshift Explorer` panel of the `JBoss` perspective of JBDS
. Right-click on the previously created connection to `broker00.ose.opentlc.com`.
+
Using your `OPENTLC-SSO` credentials, a connection to `broker00.ose.opentlc.com` should already exist after having completed the {mwlaboverviewsetup} guide.

. Select: `New -> Application` .
+
Since you have already created a domain from the previous introductory lab, the workflow for creation of a new application will be slightly different than what you are used to.
In particular, the OSE plugin will not prompt you for the creation of a new domain.

. The following `New or existing OpenShift Application` pop-up should appear:
+
image::images/new_OSE_app_bpm.png[]

.. In the `Name` text box, enter: `bpmsapp`
.. From the `Type` drop-down, select: JBoss BPMS 6.0 (rhgpe-bpms-6.0)
.. From the `Gear profile` drop-down, select: pds_medium
.. From the `Embeddable Cartridges` section, select: `MySQL 5.1`

. Click `Next`
. A new dialogue appears entitled `Set up Project for new OpenShift Aplication`.
+
Check the check box for `Disable automatic maven build when pushing to OpenShift`.
Afterwards, Click `Next`.

. A new dialogue appears entitled `Import an existing OpenShift application`.
+
Even though it will not be used, you will be forced to clone the remote git enabled project associated with your new OpenShift application.
Select a location on your local filesystem where the git enabled project should be cloned to.
+
image::images/gitclonelocation_bpm.png[]

. Click `Finish`
. The OSE plugin of JBDS will spin for a couple of minutes as the remote BPM Suite 6 enabled OpenShift application is created.
. Eventually, the OSE plugin will prompt with a variety of pop-up related details regarding your new application.
+
Click through all of them except when you come to the dialogue box entitled `Publish bpmsapp?`.
For this dialogue box, click `No`
+
image::images/publishbpmslab.png[]

=== BPM Suite 6 App Verification

. Using the `Remote System Explorer` perspective of JBDS, open an SSH terminal and tail the `bpms/standalone/log/server.log` of your remote BPM Suite 6 enabled OSE application
. Log messages similar to the following should appear:
+
image::images/newbpmlogfile.png[]


== Configuration and Execution

=== local: Clone this reference architecture
This reference architecture will be cloned both in your local computer as well as in your remote BPM Suite 6 Openshift environment.
To clone this reference architecture in your local environment, execute the following:

. Open the `Git` perspective of JBDS.
. In the `Git Repositories` panel, click the link that allows you to `Clone a Git Repository and add the clone to this view`
. A pop-up should appear with a name of `Source Git Repository`
. In the `URI` field, enter the following:
+
-----

-----

. Click `Next`
+
image::images/clone_repo_to_local.png[]

. Continue to click `Next` through the various screens
+
On the pop-up screen entitled `Local Destination`, change the default value of the `Directory` field to your preferred location on disk.
For the purposes of the remainder of these instructions, this directory on your local filesystem will be referred to as:  $REF_ARCH_HOME

. On the last screen of the `Clone Git Repository` pop-up, click `Finish`
+
Doing so will clone this `bpm_jms_exec_server` project to your local disk

. In JBDS, switch to the `Project Explorer` panel and navigate to:  `File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven Projects`
. In the `Root Directory` field of the `Maven Projects` pop-up, navigate to the location on disk where the `bpm_jms_exec_server` project was just cloned to.
+
image::images/import_mvn_project.png[]

. Click `next` through the various pop-up panels and finally `Finish`.
. Your `Project Explorer` panel should now include the following mavenized projects
+
image::images/maven_projects.png[]

=== local: Build the Reference Architecture
This reference architecture includes various sub-projects that need to be built locally.
To build the various sub-projects, execute the following:

. In the `Project Explorer` panel of JBDS, right-click on the `parent` project
. Navigate to: `Run As -> Maven Install`
. In the `Console` panel, a `BUILD SUCCESS` log message should appear.
+
image::images/maven_build_success.png[]

=== BPM Suite 6: Domain jar deployment 
This reference architecture includes a subproject called `domain`.  
This sub-project contains a maven build file along with the application specific domain classes for this reference architecture.  
In `Project Explorer`, examine the domain classes and notice that they include Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB) annotations.  

The following are directions for deploying the jar file to your remote BPM Suite 6 server running in OpenShift.

From your local cloned copy of this reference architecture execute the following:

. In the `Project Explorer` panel of the `JBOSS` perspective of JBDS, right-click on the `domain/target/domain-1.0.jar` in `Project Explorer` and select `Copy`.
+
image::images/domainjar.png[]

. In the `Remote System Explorer` perspective of JBDS, navigate to `bpmsapp-<your domain>.apps.ose.opentlc.com -> Sftp Files -> My Home -> bpms -> standalone -> deployments -> business-central.war -> WEB-INF -> lib`
. Right-click and select `Paste`
+
image::images/pastedomainjarintobizcentral.png[]

=== BPM Suite 6:  Add the WIH class to the class-path
Similar to the application domain model library, the library containing the JMS custom workItemHandler also needs to be added to the classpath of the remote BPM Suite 6 server.

. In the `Project Explorer` panel of the `JBOSS` perspective of JBDS, right-click on the `wih/target/domain-1.0.jar` in `Project Explorer` and select `Copy`.
+
image::images/wihjar.png[]

. In the `Remote System Explorer` perspective of JBDS, navigate to `bpmsapp-<your domain>.apps.ose.opentlc.com -> Sftp Files -> My Home -> bpms -> standalone -> deployments -> business-central.war -> WEB-INF -> lib`
. Right-click and select `Paste`

=== BPM Suite 6: Register Service Task Mapping
The name `JMSProducerTask` needs to be mapped to the custom WorkItemHandler included in this reference architecture and registered with the BPM Suite 6 process engine.
The mapping between Service Task name and its workItemHandler implementation can be defined in a pre-existing BPM Suite 6 configuration file.
This can be accomplished as follows:

. In the `Remote System Explorer` perspective, ssh into the `bpmsapp` gear.
. execute: vi `~/bpms/standalone/deployments/business-central.war/WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/CustomWorkItemHandlers.conf`
.. notice the existing mappings for various base-product Service Tasks (Log, WebService, Rest)
.. add a comma to the end of the last service task mapping and then append the following:
+
-----
"JMSProducerTask": new com.redhat.gpe.refarch.bpm_jms_exec_server.processTier.JMSWorkItemHandler()
-----
+
image::images/customservicetasks.png[]

. Save the change and quit 
. Switch back to the `OpenShift Explorer` panel in JBDS and restart the `bpmsapp` application.

=== BPM Suite 6: Understand BPM Suite 6 Message Queues
When the business-central Workbench is deployed, the embedded _Execution Server_ begins to listen on the following queues already configured in the Hornetq subsystem:

* jms/queue/KIE.SESSION
* jms/queue/KIE.TASK
* jms/queue/KIE.RESPONSE
* jms/queue/KIE.AUDIT

The `KIE.SESSION` and `KIE.TASK` queues should be used to send command request messages to the JMS API of the BPM Suite 6 Execution Server. 
Command response messages will be then placed on the `KIE.RESPONSE` queue. 
Command request messages that involve starting and managing business processes should be sent to the `KIE.SESSION` and command request messages that involve managing human tasks, should be sent to the `KIE.TASK` queue.

Messages sent to the two different input queues, `KIE.SESSION` and `KIE.TASK`, will be processed in the same manner regardless of which queue they are sent to.
The reason that two input queues are provided (rather than just one) is to allow for messages to be prioritized with more control.  
For example, in some use-cases, clients may send many more requests involving human tasks than requests involving business processes.  
If the business-process related messages are sent to `KIE.SESSION` and the human-task related messages are sent to `KIE.TASK`, then processing of business-process related messages occurs independent of processing of human-task related messages.

The BPM Suite 6 Execution Server uses a Message Driven Bean (MDB) to process messages from the queues.  
To change any of the configuration details of the MDBs, navigate to the following file in the BPM Suite 6 JVM and modify as appropriate:  

----------
~/bpms/standalone/deployments/business-central.war/WEB-INF/ejb-jar.xml
----------

In your remote Openshift environment provisioned with BPM Suite 6, the 3 JMS API Execution Server queues are already created in the default messaging subsystem: HornetQ. 
To view them, open your browser to the JBoss EAP management console `(http://<your_openshift_host>/console/App.html)` of your remote Openshift environment and navigate to:  Profile -> Subsystems -> Messaging -> Destinations -> default -> View .  
The following should appear:

image::images/queues.png[]

Also, enabled by default in your remote Openshift environment is the messaging configuration: _message-counter-enabled_.  
This will prove useful later when executing the included load test to easily visualize real-time messaging statistics per queue.  
The overhead of enabling messaging statistics in HornetQ is negligible.

By default, authentication to the Hornetq messaging subsystem is enabled in JBoss EAP 6.  
Also, authorization rules are set to restrict only authenticated users with a role of _admin_ the ability to send messages to the BPM Suite 6 queues.  
These messaging security settings can be seen by navigating to the following the JBoss EAP management console of your Openshift environment:  Profile -> Subsystems -> Messaging -> Destinations -> default -> Security Settings.

image::images/messaging_security.png[]

The remote Openshift environment provisioned with JBoss EAP and BPM Suite 6 has already been pre-configured to allow for the _jboss_ user to send messages to the BPM Suite 6 queues.  
Therefore, your JMS clients sending process-instance and human task related messages to the BPM Suite 6 JMS API should do so as the 'jboss' user. 

=== Add the _JmsServiceQueue_
The *bpm_jms_exec_server* business process definition defines a custom Service Task whose corresponding custom workItemHandler will send a message to a business queue in the co-located Hornetq sub-system.  
This business queue (called _JmsServiceQueue_ ) needs to be created in the Hornetq subsystem.  

To create this queue, execute the following:

. In your browser, authenticate into the JBoss EAP Management Console of your remote BPM Suite 6 environment
. navigate to:  Profile -> Subsystems -> Messaging -> Destinations -> default -> View -> Queues/Topics -> Add
+
image::images/add_queue.png[]

. Populate the dialog box as follows:
.. Name : `JmsServiceQueue`
.. JNDI Names :  `java:/queue/JmsServiceQueue`
. There should now be 5 queues configured in the Hornetq messaging subsystem:
+
image::images/fivequeues.png[] 

=== BPM Suite 6: Clone this reference architecture
Use the following steps to clone this reference architecture in BPM Suite 6:

. Open your browser and log into the `BPM Console` of BPM Suite 6
+
The userId to use is:  `jboss`  and the password to use is:  `brms`

. Navigate to:  Authoring -> Administration.
. Select `Organizational Units` -> `Manage Organizational Units`
. Under `Organizational Unit Manager`, select the `Add` button
. Enter a name of _gpe_ and an owner of _jboss_. Click `OK`
. Clone this `bpm_jms_exec_server` repository in BPM Suite 6
.. Select `Repositories` -> `Clone Repository` .
.. Populate the _Clone Repository_ box as follows:
+
image::images/clone_repo.png[]

... `Repository Name` :  _bpmjmsexecserver_
... `Organizational Unit` : _gpe_
... `Git URL` :     _https://github.com/jboss-gpe-ref-archs/bpm_jms_exec_server.git_
.. Click `Clone`
.. Once successfully cloned, BPM Suite 6 will pop-up a new dialog box with the message:  _The repository is cloned successfully_

=== BPM Suite 6: Review and deploy the *processTier* project
. View the _processTier_ project in your BPM Suite 6 server
.. Select `Authoring` -> `Project Authoring`
.. Make sure the `processTier` repository is view-able in the `Project Explorer`
... Toggle the view using the wheel icon image:images/wheel.png[] if needed.
. From within the business-central workbench, select `Authoring` -> `Project Authoring`
. Find and open the `bpm_jms_exec_server` BPMN2 business process in the Web Designer
. Open the `Properties` panel for the process and notice the process Id value of `processTier.bpm_jms_exec_server`. 
+
image::images/processproperties.png[]
+
This will be used in the client's JMS message.

Use the following steps to create a deployment for the project:

. From within the business-central workbench, select `Tools` -> `Project Editor`
. Select the `Build & Deploy` button.
. After the build completes, select `Deploy` -> `Deployments`
. Take note of the deployment Id in the column labeled `Deployment`.
If you used the values in this document, then the deployment ID will be: `com.redhat.gpe.refarch.bpm_jms_exec_server:processTier:1.0`.  
This value will be used in the client's JMS message.

=== Local: Port-forward remote Hornetq broker
HornetQ accepts inbound TCP connections on port `5445`.
This port is not a default open port in OpenShift Enterprise. 
Subsequently, port 5445 needs to be tunneled using ssh from your local to your remote BPM Suite 6 environment.

. Switch to the `OpenShift Explorer` panel of the `JBoss` perspective of JBDS and right-click on the `bpmsapp`.
. Select `Port Forwarding` and click the `Start All` button.
. Notice that the status of all port-forwarded ports (most importently 5445) should be `Started`
+
image::images/portforwarding.png[]

While port forwarded ssh tunnels are running, the remote HornetQ broker can be accessed on the local computer at `localhost:5445`.

=== Local: Configure the JMS Client
The JMS Client is located in the *$REF_ARCH_HOME/loadTest* directory of this reference architecture.  
It is a java class that builds an instance of the _Policy_ domain object and sends the object in a JMS Message to the BPM Suite 6 server to start a business process.  
The name of the class is *com.redhat.gpe.refarch.bpm_jms_exec_server.loadtest.JMSClient*.  
Note that this class also extends the JMeter AbstractJavaSamplerClient class.
Use of JMeter with this reference architecture will be discussed in the next section of this documentation.

. Import the $REF_ARCH_HOME/loadtest maven project into JBDS
+
The `bpms_jms_exec_server/loadtest` maven project was not previously included in the original import earlier in this reference architecture.

.. Switch to the `Project Explorer` panel of the JBDS and select `File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven Projects`
.. Click `Next` and browse to the location on disk of `REF_ARCH_HOME/loadtest`
+
image::images/importloadtest.png[]

.. Click `Finish`

This document will not cover aspects of this client that are common to sending JMS messages.
However, there are a few important details in the client that are specific to this use case that require further explanation.
These details are discussed in the following sections.

==== JAXB marshalling
The client class uses JAXB to serialize the POJOs before sending them via JMS.
The following is required by the client to provide the JAXB context required for serializing the POJO on the client side:

.Providing the JAXB context on the client
----------
/* -------  Required for proper serialization on the Client side (for the JAXB context) ------- */
jaxbSerializationProvider.addJaxbClasses(Policy.class);
----------

On the server side, these objects must be deserialized via JAXB.
For this to occur the server must know the type of the object contained within the message.
To provide this information on the server, a special string property is is added to the JMS message by the following code.
 
The following code snipped is from the `sendJMSJaxCommandsRequest` method of the class:

.Providing Context for JAXB Deserialization
----------
/* ----- Required for deserialization on the server ---------- */
Set<Class<?>> extraJaxbClasses = new HashSet<Class<?>>();
extraJaxbClasses.add(Policy.class);
String extraJaxbClassesPropertyValue = JaxbSerializationProvider.classSetToCommaSeperatedString(extraJaxbClasses);
msg.setStringProperty(EXTRA_JAXB_CLASSES_PROPERTY_NAME, extraJaxbClassesPropertyValue);
----------

In this code snipped, *Policy.class* is the class for the POJO object called Policy.
If additional classes were required, then simply add more calls to the `extraJaxbClasses.add` method.

==== Local: Provide the target for the message
Once the object has been deserialized on the server, the Execution Server must know which deployment is the target of the message.
For this information, another string property is set on the JMS message as shown in the follow code snippet:

.Providing the DeploymentID
----------
/* ------- Required for the server to locate the target deployment for the process --------- */
msg.setStringProperty(DEPLOYMENT_ID_PROPERTY_NAME, deploymentId);
----------

The value for `deploymentId` is provided as a property in the *$REF_ARCH_HOME/loadtest/pom.xml* file, and initialized in the constructor for this class.

==== BPM Suite 6 command objects
The client use a BPM Suite 6 command objects to provides a programmatic interface to the JMS API and take care of the underlying details of sending and receiving commands via JMS.
The following code of the client is used to create the command object for starting a process in BPM Suite 6:

.StartProcess Command object
----------
// create the start process command object
StartProcessCommand cmd = new StartProcessCommand(processId); <1>
        
// populate domain model classes
Policy policyObj = populatePolicyObject();
cmd.putParameter(POLICY, policyObj);  <2>
        
// send the start process command
JaxbCommandsRequest req = new JaxbCommandsRequest(deploymentId, cmd); <3>
----------
<1> The *StartProcessCommand* object is created.  The `processId` of the target process is provided as parameter to the command.
<2> The call to *putParameter* on the command object is used to provide the payload.
<3> The StartProcessCommand object is then sent as parameter to the *JaxbCommandRequest* wrapper object.

The StartProcessCommand object is only one of may commands that can be processed by the execution server.
For a complete list of available commands see {commands}.

=== Local: Execute test
Before executing the test, open the *loadtest/pom.xml* file and configure the parameters to suite your server.
In particular be sure that the following properties are correct for your environment:

* process.id
* deploymentId
* hornetq.host
* hornetq.user
* hornetq.password

To execute the process do the following:

. In the `Remote System Explorer` perspective, ssh into your remote BPM Suite 6 gear and tail the log file at:
+
-----
~/bpms/standalone/log/server.log
-----

. In the `Project Explorer` panel, right-click on the new `loadtest` project and select:  `Run As -> Maven build`
+
image::images/loadtestselectrunas.png[]

. In the `Edit configuration and launch` pop-up enter the following in the `Goals` field:  `clean verify`
+
image::images/executeloadtest.png[]

. Click `Apply` and `Run`

=== BPM Suite 6:  View results
* The `bpms/standalone/log/server.log` of your remote BPM Suite 6 enabled Openshift Environment should include statements similar to the following:

-------
[com.redhat.gpe.refarch.bpm_jms_exec_server.processTier.JMSWorkItemHandler]  Sending messageContent: Driver  properties =
    driverName : alex
    dlNumber : 7
    age : 21
    # accidents : 0
    # tickets : 1
    SSN : 555-55-555
    # creditScore : 800
-------

* Also, in the JBoss EAP Management Console, navigate to Runtime -> JMS Destinations -> JmsServiceQueue, and  notice that JMS messages have begun to accumulate in the previously configured _JmsServiceQueue_ :

image::images/message_stats.png[]



== Performance Testing
In the following we measure the system impact when changes are made to configuration parameters on the JMS interface between BPM Suite 6 and 
JMS client applications.  Other relevant BPM Suite 6 configuration options are also taken into consideration.
* Queue sizing
* message listener configuration
* durable vs non-durable queues
* Single process knowledge session vs process per request
