== PURPOSE:
* Discuss use-cases for JMS API exposed by Execution Server of BPM Suite 6
* Demonstrate use of JMS API exposed by Execution Server of BPM Suite 6
* Provide harness to drive load-testing of Execution Server of BPM Suite 6 via the JMS API

== OVERVIEW:
The focus of this reference architecture is on the JMS API exposed by the Execution Server of BPM Suite 6.
For the purposes of this reference architecture, the target run-time environment is a BPM Suite 6 enabled 
gear in OpenShift.  With minimal changes, this reference architecture could also be applied tp a BPM Suite 6
environment provisioned in a local, non-PaaS environment as well.

This reference architecture includes the following {ref_arch_doc} and also includes both client and server-side source code to a scenario called _policyQuote_.  
This _policyQuote_ scenario is referenced throughout the manual.
A load test harness (based on JMeter) is included to allow for the ability to observe the behavior and stability of the BPM Suite 6 product under peak load conditions.
